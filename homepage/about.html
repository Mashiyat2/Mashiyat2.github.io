      <div class="write">
        <p>	Eleven years. For eleven years I have passed by it—Napoli Pizza & Pasta. No matter where my feet seem to take me, I always see that pizza store from the corner of my tired eyes. Those glaring neon letters glow in my soul, maybe even more than my mom saying “Do your homework.” It doesn’t matter if I’m walking to my neighbor’s house, if  I’m walking to the depths of the Broadway train station in Astoria, or if  I’m taking the vacant Q66 bus to Marshalls on Northern Boulevard. It’s always there, like a cheetah eerily stalking its prey. Is it following me? Or am I following it? </p>
        <p>I cross the street and the fumes of steaming tomato sauce linger in the frigid air. Orders shout. “One large cheese pizza and 16 garlic knots for Ruby!” I’ll admit those garlic knots are exquisite—toasted garlic with cilantro and parmesan cheese. The sweet dough pastries, which I still don’t know the name of, are smothered with powdered sugar. The store seems small at first, but there is a whole concert in the back. Parents and their little ones come after school with their backpacks and empty water bottles ready to chow down on fettuccine alfredo. There’s hardly any space to squeeze through. The dim, warm tones illuminate the room. Who knew that a random pizza store in this city could have as much energy as a puppy reuniting with its owner after two years? It’s quite a great sight, homey at best. Warmth. Smiles. Satisfaction. </p>
        <p>Cold. Frowns. Dissatisfaction. Honking cars, the stench emanating from the sewers, the crowded subways cars, and the speed walking. You’re supposed to wake up at 6AM. It’s 6:45. Just like yesterday, you awaken like the dead coming back to life. You brush your teeth, not even for a full two minutes. Drink some coffee—black coffee. Wear some socks—one red and one green that’s two sizes too big. Put on your sneakers—untied. Get out the door, but guess what? You forgot your keys. It’s 7:00. You bolt out the door. Now, don’t you forget about the dreadful incline to get to the station. Ankles throbbing. Glasses foggy as fog. There’s one minute till the M train arrives, but guess what? The train doors slam in front of your drained face. All you can do is sigh. That sigh doesn’t have to last forever, though. Your face lights up when walking by where your heart feels at peace. </p>
        <p>For me, that peace is Napoli Pizza & Pasta, but why? New York City—a city with five boroughs and eight million people from across the world. It’s a city with a countless number of adventures to partake in, from skating in the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, to attending street fairs, and eating at pizza stores. When I ask someone what NYC is known for, I am sure to hear pizza at some point. No matter where you walk in this black hole, pizza is sure to be in the vicinity. It’s so common that people might not even give the pizza store next to their house a second thought. For them, it’s just another pigeon on the street. People fly by pizza all the time, so why Napoli Pizza & Pasta? </p>
        <p>It’s because it’s home. The voices that radiate my sidewalk like the moon in the sky. The gust of hugs that consume me when I walk by those doors. The place I come to after developing a headache. The cheering of the kids from school, my elementary school—I remember the day when I scurried across the street to go eat some pizza. It was a tedious day from the start. I had two tests, which was stressful enough for my fourth grader self. My eyes were falling and my hands were trembling. I didn’t feel much better after the tests either. At the end of the day, I was greeted by my dad who offered to buy some pizza. That was the highlight of my day. It drew a smile on my face. So, that’s why Napoli Pizza & Pasta. For eleven years I have passed by it, eleven years and counting. </p>
